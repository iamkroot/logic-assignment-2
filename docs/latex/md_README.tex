Submission for Assignment 2 of CS F214 -\/ Logic in CS, 2018-\/19.

\subsection*{Running}

Start by running the {\ttfamily Logic} file (precompiled) in a Linux terminal.

\subsection*{Features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Modularized code, separated into various files.
\item Namespaces for constants so as to not pollute the global namespace.
\item Well documented, including time complexities of every function.
\item Performance and stress tested, to see the limits of the program.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Part 1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Convert an infix expression to postfix form
\item Convert a postfix expression to a Binary Parse Tree
\item Convert a Binary Parse Tree to infix expression
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Part 2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Check validity of a given proof in propositional logic with a limited set of rules
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Premise
\item And introduction
\item And elimination
\item Or introduction
\item Implication eliminiation
\item Modus Tollens
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item We convert the formula of each line to its parse tree, and then compare the inorder strings of previous proof lines as required by the rule.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Assumptions and Performance Testing}

\subsubsection*{Part 1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We assume that the given formula of only contains propositional atoms made up of the 26 lowercase English alphabets, and that it is well formed propositional formula.
\item We have implemented a operator priority based approach to resolve ambiguity in case the formula is not well parenthesized.
\end{DoxyItemize}
